# SQUIRREL-CENSUS


## Central Park Squirrel Census Analysis ##

-> This project analyzes data from the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census, focusing on the primary fur colors of squirrels.

-> In this project we essentially processes the original squirrel census data, counts the number of squirrels by their primary fur color, and saves this summary information in a new CSV file.

1. Project Description

This Python script processes the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data to count the number of squirrels by their primary fur color (gray, black, and cinnamon). It then saves this summary information in a new CSV file.

2. Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

3. Usage

- Ensure you have the required CSV file: "2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv" in the same directory as the script.

4. File Descriptions

- `squirrel_census.py`: The main Python script that performs the analysis.
- `2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv`: Input data file.
- `squirrel_count.csv`: Output file generated by the script.

5. Data Source

The original data comes from the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw).

6. License

This project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Break Down ##

1.First, the code imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis.

2.It then reads a csv file named "2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv" into a pandas Dataframe called data.

3.The code extracts the "Primary Fur Color" coloumn form the DataFrame and finds the unique values in this column.

4.It then counts the number of squirrels for each primary fur color ( Gray, Black, and cinnamon/red).

5. A new dictionary "data_dict" is created with the fur colors and their respective counts.

6. This dictionary is then converted into a new pandas DataFrame called "info1".

7. Finally, the new DataFrame "info1" is saved as a CSV file named "squirrel_counts.csv".
